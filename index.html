    <h2>CS 428 - Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality</h2>

    <h3>Project 1</h3>
    <p>Project 1 is an Augmented Reality Project that involves displaying models on 2 cubes.</p>
    <p>Using your webcam or phone camera, showing the cube will allow models of an attraction of my choosing to appear on the cubes. </p>
    <p>
        For the project, I chose Nikuyokocho from Shubuya, Tokyo, Japan. Nikuyokocho is a street that is known for its grilled meat and restaurants.
        For the second cube, I chose Millenium Park in Chicago, Illinois. Millenium Park is a park that is known for its art and architecture.
