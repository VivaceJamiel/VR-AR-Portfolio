    <h2>CS 428 - Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality</h2>

    <h3>Project 1</h3>
    <p>Project 1 is an Augmented Reality Project that involves displaying models, or knickknacks, on 2 paper cubes.</p>
    <p>Using your webcam or phone camera, showing the cube will allow models of an attraction of my choosing to appear on the cubes. </p>
    <p>
        For the project, I chose Nikuyokocho from Shubuya, Tokyo, Japan. Nikuyokocho is a street that is known for its grilled meat and restaurants.
        For the second cube, I chose Millenium Park in Chicago, Illinois. Millenium Park is a park that is known for its art and architecture.
    </p>
    <h4>Here is the <a href="https://github.com/VivaceJamiel/AR-Millenium-Nikuyokocho-jimpoy2">link</a> to the github of the project</h4>
    <h1>How it works</h1>
    <p>
        Vuforia is the software used to make this possible. The software is able to use a camera and see the pattern on each face of the cubes like a code, in order to track its movement and recognize that its a cube.
        Once the software recognizes the cube, it will then display the knickknacks of the attractions on the cube. The user is able to move the cube freely as they wish and the knickknack will move and track with the cube.
    </p>
    <p>The knickknacks themselves were put together using Unity, with models found on the web as well as custom models made with blender.</p>
    <h1>The knickknacks</h1>
    <p>The first knicknack is nikuyokocho, a famous restaurant alley in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan that is known for its meat and protein focused foods. I have visited there and the models represent how I view the place. The second knicknack is Millenium Park in Chicago, Illinois. I frequent the park whenever I have free time and visit a lot of places and attraction in the park</p>
    
    <h2>Nikuyokocho Models</h2>
    <h3>Shiba Inu</h3>
        <p>
            When I visted Nikutyokocho, there was a Shiba Inu that was sitting outside one of the restaurants. It really stuck with me the whole time I was there and I could not stop passing by to say hi to the dog. This model was imported.

        </p>
    <h3>Torii Gate</h3>
        <p>
            There was a Torii Shrine gate that was part of a restaurant or an entrance to the alley. I couldn't remember exactly because it has been nearly a decade since I've been there. This model was imported.

        </p>
    <h3>Sushi platter</h3>
        <p>
            When my family and I went to the restaurant, at the time, I hadn't gotten around to liking meat and beef all that much. So I ordered salmon sushi, which was interesting because the alley was known for meat This model was created by me, in Blender
        </p>
    <h3>Vending Machine</h3>
        <p>
            Japan is known for its vending machine in public areas. When I went to Nikuyokocho, I found the vending machines really cool as a child. I would always ask for money to get a canned drink even though I wasn't interested in the drink. I was more interested in the vending machine dispensing the drink. This model was created by me, in Blender
        </p>
    <h3>Ramen Yatai</h3>
        <p>
            In the alley, there was a Ramen Food stall, also called a Ramen Yatai. I found it really cool when my parents told me that the stall itself is able to be rolled around and be moved to another place, making it really portable and able to serve ramen anywhere. This model was imported.

    <h2>Chicago Models</h2>
    <h3>Buckingham Fountain</h3>
        <p>This fountain is iconic when thinking about Millenium Park. My family would always show relatives the fountain when they would come and visit Chicago. I occasionally drop by the fountain on a warm day and stay in the misty areas. This model was imported. </p>

    <h3>Ice Rink</h3>
        <p>During the winter months, the area under the bean is converted to an ice rink. This is memerable to me because I had gone Ice skating there for the first time near New Years. It was tiring but well worth the experience. This model is imported.</p>

    <h3>Lion Statues</h3>
        <p>The lion statues are representing the lion statues at the stairs of the Art Institute of Chicago. I would always pass by the statues when I visit the museum for the purposes of class and my own personal enjoyment. The models are imported.</p>

    <h3>Crown Fountains</h3>
        <p>This Crown Fountains are my favorite place to be at in Millenium Park. I would always just wade in the water when I'm feeling extra warm that day and seeing the faces are always so funny. The model is made by me, in Blender. Faces are imported.</p>

    <h3>Cloud Gate</h3>
        <p>An iconic attraction in Millenium Park. It's always visible for most of the park and its a place people always go to, including myself, when visiting. During winter months, the ice rink placed in the area under the bean. This model was made by me, in Blender.</p>
